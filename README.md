# SQL Management Agent
By using the Management Agent for Microsoft SQL Server, you can synchronize almost any type of information with SQL Server tables - using Forefront Identity Manager 2010 R2 (FIM2010) or Microsoft Identity Manager 2016 (MIM2016).

## Features
This MA has a lot of features that are needed for a modern FIM2010 or MIM2016 setup:

* Full and delta imports
* Delta and full exports
* Can retain and restore deleted information/rows
*Can execute pre- and post-import/export stored procedures

The schema is very flexible and is generated based on the database table definitions. A refresh of the schema for this management agent rediscovers the schema, and you can override the structure in different ways using configurable XML data.

To learn more, please see the Wiki.
